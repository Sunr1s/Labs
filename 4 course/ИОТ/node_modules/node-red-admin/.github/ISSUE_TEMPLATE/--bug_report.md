<!--
This issue tracker is for problems with the Node-RED runtime, the editor or the core nodes.

If your issue is:
  - a general 'how-to' type question,
  - a feature request or suggestion for a change,
  - or problems with 3rd party (`node-red-contrib-`) nodes

please use the [Node-RED Forum](https://discourse.nodered.org) or [slack team](https://nodered.org/slack).

You could also consider asking a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red) and tag it `node-red`.

That way the whole Node-RED user community can help, rather than rely on the core development team.

To help us understand the issue, please fill-in as much of the following information as you can:
